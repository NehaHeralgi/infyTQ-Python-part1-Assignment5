'''
The road transport corporation (RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route is running on profit or loss.

Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80

The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss.
